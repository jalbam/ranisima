Description

Open source game that was written totally in DHTML (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and was inspired by the Space invaders classic although uses infantile graphics that will be loved by the youngest children.

It is my first DHTML game and it was made in early 2006 based on DOM manipulation, when almost nobody knew about the power of JavaScript for game development and all the technologies involved related with that were unknown by the vast majority of developers who preferred to develop games using Flash or even Java.

You can also change the game behaviour easily by editing many of the configuration variables which are at the beginning of the script. To change the game images you just need to replace them with others.

Official languages are Spanish and English.

You can find other modified and adapted versions of this game on the Internet, including one Opera widget.

This game has been tested under BeOS, Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Windows, Mac OS X and others.
